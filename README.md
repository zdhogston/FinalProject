# Final Project
The objective was to practice a number of different things learned throughout the bootcamp course and to act as a pentester and SOC analyst.

- Implement alarms and thresholds in Elasticsearch Watcher.
- Find vulnerabilities / exploits to gain access to a vulnerable WordPress site / server.
- Use Wireshark to analyze and find malicious traffic on the wire.
- Create a team presentation with the assessment, analysis and hardening of the vulnerable system.
